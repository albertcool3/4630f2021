# Short Description of Final Project for Comp.4630-Mobile App Development I

Albert Li

## Current Version
I used my favorite UI, bottom navigation created a calendar application presents a monthly view and a weekly view, I implemented two different color themes for the app, however I realize the way to apply themes should follow Jetpack Compose and Jetpack Material Design theme convention instead of hard coding my own colors. (Part of the reason I want to switch to Jetpack Compose and Kotlin) I also have function that lists out events, however it does not have a proper database system to save the information between sessions.
This version uses Java and XML based UI

## The Kotlin Version
I am working on the next iteration using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. I will convert the Recycle View in the XML/Java version into lazy row and lazy column. I am also going to properly implement Light/Dark themes using material design. I wm going to replace the navigation UI with DrawerView
