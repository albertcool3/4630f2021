#Short Description of Project

My Calendar App fallsunder the productivity category. Although there are numerous calendar apps out there, suprisingly, there is still room for smaller players:
- [The Notion App] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notion_(productivity_software))
- [Boost from Indiana University] (https://kb.iu.edu/d/atud)
But for me, my goal is mainly to practice the Android development techniques I gathered over the semester. My Initial approach was to follow the Sunshine project from Udacity because it is a well made weather application. I used part of the code from that project for my homework 2 and thought I could adapt this into my Final Project as it has the desired features I wanted to implement. As I spent more time on this project, I discovered it does not take advantage of modern developement architectures and libraries. For example, it does not have a viewModel and does not use any JetPack libraries. I later discovered that the Android Developement techniques have changed dramatically. The XML based UI and view are now considered outdated and the new approach uses Jetpack Compose(no XML is involved in the UI design)
After some consideration I decided to switch to Kotlin using Jetpack Compose for my calendar Project.
