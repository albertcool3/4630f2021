#Build Instructions
##Download source code from [Github] (https://github.com/albertcool3/4630f2021/tree/main/FinalProjectCalendarKotlin)
##Using Android Studio Arctic Fox, open the project directory and click on the build button.

##Usage
The interface has a drawer with five menu items:
- Events
- Calendars
- Edit Events
- Trash
- Enable Light/Dark Mode

By default the application will display a screen composed of all existing tasks. After the user clicks on a task, a new screen will pop up to let the user edit the task, the user can change the title, description, and/or date of the selected task. The user can also associate the task with their own choice of color to organize the tasks.
The calendar screen shows up from either the drawer menu or when the user wants to set a day(s) for a selected task. The user can also delete a task which will be moved to the trash screen.
There's also a floating app button in the main event screen(part of scaffold that follows Android UI convention) will bring up a empty task template for the user to create a new task.
